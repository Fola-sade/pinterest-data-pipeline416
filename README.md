## Project description
Pinterest, a popular social media platform and visual discovery engine, allows users to save and share ideas through images and videos known as "pins." Users organise their pins into themed collections called "boards," covering diverse topics like home decor, fashion, recipes, and more. With vast data storage and processing billions of data points daily, Pinterest aims to enhance user experience by leveraging data insights.

This project aims to replicate Pinterest's data processing system by creating an end-to-end pipeline on the AWS Cloud. The pipeline orchestrates data ingestion, storage, and real-time analysis, utilising a range of technologies:

Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) for computing resources Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) for scalable object storage SQL for data querying and manipulation Apache Kafka/AWS Managed Streaming for Apache Kafka (MSK) for streaming data processing Amazon API Gateway for creating APIs Spark for distributed data processing Databricks for data engineering and analytics Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA) for workflow orchestration Amazon Kinesis for real-time data streaming By leveraging these technologies, this project aims to demonstrate how to build a secure, robust and scalable data processing pipeline similar to that of Pinterest via AWS Cloud. Additionally, the pipeline facilitates value extraction through SQL queries, enhancing the project's analytical capabilities.
